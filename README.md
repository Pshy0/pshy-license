# pshy-license
A simple free license, based on the MIT License, compatible with all free and non-free licenses, unless they add restrictions on modified versions of the original work.

This license also provides the option to, rather than including the whole license in all portions of the software, simply provide a reference instead, alongside the information from the copyright notice, with no format restriction.

It also enforce that modified versions of the program, but not the program implementing the licensed components, be released with the same license. Which means it can be used in a project licensed with another copyleft license, but changes to the components licensed under the PSHY License must remain under that license. For instance, if someone fix a bug in a function, this is not a big enough change to justify re-licensing the derived code under a different license, but adding it to an already functional program is enough.
This license therefore does not create any incompatibility with any other license, except perhaps a few abusive ones.

Although less restrictive than the LGPL, it may not be compatible with the GPL (and possibly not with the LGPL either as the LGPL allows sub-licensing under GPL), not because the PSHY License adds any restriction about that, but because of the following GPL statement:
```
If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License [the GPL] along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term.
```



# The License

The indented paragraph is the copyright notice. It does not have any specific format, the suggested fields are arbitrary.

Parens after the license name may indicate a modified version of the license.
