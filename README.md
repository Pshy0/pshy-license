# TFCL License (True Free CopyLeft License)

A simple free copyleft license, based on the MIT License.



## Status

This TFCL License is currently a work in progress.
This is the changes I intent to make:
 - Adapt the license's terms to fit all kind of works (rather than just softwares).
 - Simplify the license terms, to make it concise and easy to understand.
 - Make it clear the words I use have no externally-defined legal meaning.



## Intents

This describes the intents of this license. Future versions may be adapted to better fit them.
 - Grant the rights commonly granted by free licenses.
 - Grant the right to integrate any change, made to licensed works, under TFCL.
 - Grant the right to format the copyright notice as wished (helps integration).
 - Grant the right to reference the license and not include it (helps integration).
 - Limit the responsibility of the authors.
 - Do not spread the license to works integrating a TFCL component.



## Reasons and Purpose

Most copyleft licenses pretend to be free. However, many prohibits the use of the licensed works in most situations. This includes the following scenarios:
 - You cannot release sources (due to company policy, legal, or safety reasons).
 - You want to use a different license for your project.
 - You need components that have different spreading copyleft licenses.

Many of those licenses purposefully make themselves incompatible with others, even free licenses. This prevents you from using both, forcing you to take party. This is because such licenses seek dominance, not freedom. The additional restrictions, aimed at giving the license's author the monopoly to define how free software must be redistributed, violate the principles of a free software. That is a huge problem to me.

The MIT license, in the other hand, is too permissive. It allows the licensed work to be re-licensed, in a way that would make it non-free. I am not against my work being re-used, even in private projects, with proprietary licenses. But I find immoral that my work be re-used in a project that pretends to be free as well, while in reality, it, or a modified version of it, is re-licensed in a way that prevent, even myself, from re-using it the way I originally intended everyone to be able to.

The TFCL license fixes this by requiring that all modifications to the original work are also released under the original license, without enforcing this term to derivative works. So a project, as a whole, can use a license that differs from the component's license, which remains under the TFCL.



## Compatibility

The TFCL License grants you the right to use it in any other non-TFCL project.
However, some non-free licenses may prohibit you from doing so.
Unfortunately, this includes licenses that pretends to be free, but really are not.
In this case, it is not the TFCL license that removes this right from you.



## The License

Read the license with markdown highlights: [TFCL License v0](./TFCL.md).

**NOTES:**
- The copyright notice is the line with `Copyright`.
- The copyright notice does not have any specific format, but it is a good idea to include a contact information or a link to your original work.
- I recommend keeping the `Copyright` word and all the copyright notice's fields on the same line, so it is clearer what constitutes the copyright notice. Or you can indent the whole paragraph to make it clearer.
- Keep the `.md` extension in the license file's name. This will cause the disclaimer of warranty and liability to be highlighted when visualized.
- I named the license `True Free CopyLeft` because it grants the rights a free license should grant, while mocking the copyleft licenses that does not.



## License of the TFCL License

Releases of the TFCL License are licensed under the latest release of the TFCL License.

However, I reserve the right to publish new official versions of this License (versions with the same name, a version number, and, possibly, suffixes indicating a variant of the license, except if you use "MODIFIED", or other non-ambiguous terms indicating this derived work is not mine).

I also grant you the right to modify and/or redistribute any version of it under a different license, [according to the disclaimers](./TFCL.md) of the latest released TFCL License, as long as it does not involve me having any responsibility or liability for it, which means, AT YOUR OWN RISK.
