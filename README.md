# TFCL (True Free CopyLeft License) License

A simple free copyleft license, based on the MIT License.



# Reasons and Purpose

Most copyleft licenses pretend to be free. However, many prohibits the use of the licensed materials in some situations. This includes when you cannot release a modified source code (either for legal or safety reasons) or when you would like to use a different license, or add terms to the license. For instance, this is the case with the GNU GPL license, as it adds restrictions that violates the principles of a free software. While such a license is still permissive to some degree, it was not enough for me.

The MIT license, in the other hand is too permissive. It allows the licensed work to be re-licensed, in a way that would make it non-free. I am not against my work being re-used, even in private projects, with proprietary licenses. But I find immoral that my work be re-used in a project that pretends to be free as well, while in reality, it, or a modified version of it, is re-licensed in a way that prevent even myself from re-using it the way I originally intended everyone to be able to use it.

This fixes this issue in a very simple way: By requiring that all modifications to the original work can be pulled under the original license. Even if the work is re-licensed.

In addition, I wanted to make this license even more permissive than the MIT license, by removing some requirements, to make integration easier. Instead of having to include this whole license into your project, you can use a reference to it. And you do not have to strictly respect the copyright notice format, as long as the information it contains remains.

It also requires modified versions to be identified as such (That is just so bad modifications are not attributed to the original author).



# TODO

Currently, the license is only applicable to programs. I intend to make another version for any type of material.

**NOTES:**
- The copyright notice is the second paragraph.
- The copyright notice does not have any specific format, but it is a good idea to include a contact information or a link to your original work.
- I recommend keeping the `Copyright` word and all the copyright notice's fields on the same line, so it is clearer what constitutes the copyright notice. Or you can indent the whole paragraph to make it clearer.



# Trivia

- I named the license `True Free CopyLeft` because it grants the rights a free license should grant, while mocking the copyleft licenses that does not.
